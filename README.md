## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshwinKumar-V/EdieHomepage/main/.github/images/Screenshot.jpg)

Hey there devs! This was my seventh project at devChallenges.io to build a responsive website. This is a homepage for a web development company. It describes everything about the company from services to client feedbacks and their contacts. The navbar and the footer include anchored links to sections within the page and the mobile view includes a hamburger menu.
You can checkout my demo [here](https://ashwinkumar-v.github.io/EdieHomepage).
